#Mars Rover Test
This is a program to move a "rover" around a ractangular plateau with simple commands
Commands are: 
* L = Left
* R = Right
* M = Move

To start the program run `Yarn Start` 

The code is built with React JS and the testing module used is Jest and Babel
I am quite new to testing so this is a work in progress.
